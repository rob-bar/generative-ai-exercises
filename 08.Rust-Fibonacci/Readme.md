# Some Fibonacci code in Rust

Ever code something in Rust? It's a really cool language!

If you've never, you need to do the setup first go to: https://rustup.rs/

Then you'll find inside this folder a project which you can run with `cargo`

And this is what shall come out of that program: `The 30-th Fibonacci number is: 832040`
Now this is some code that needs to be optimized...

### Issues with the code:

- The recursion recalculates the Fibonacci numbers multiple times. Can we refactor this?
- There are no tests.
- No comments to explain the functionality.

Happy Refactoring!
