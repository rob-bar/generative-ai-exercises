# Generative Ai Exercises

Hi there, thanks for cloning this repository. You are awesome!

As you can see the project exists out of separate folders all prefixed with a number.
So have a look at the exercises and complete/solve or play through them starting with the first one.

# Pairing is caring ü§ù

It can always be fun to work in "pairing" mode, as developers do it all the time.
This way we can get to know each other a little bit better and we can help each other during the code session.

### Some Ground Rulesüëá:

- Do not spoil the exercises (ex: shouting out the answer to the group)
- If you are stuck, please ask for help.
- Go and use as many AI tools as you must. ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, etc.
- Install code AI tools like: [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [Amazon Code Whisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/?trk=9f7ac9e5-4be5-4601-83d1-982e5510f167&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjwkNOpBhBEEiwAb3Mvvakf6a5wodB15Mq3qc_oxaWY0QKMidOMuWp6luQZABp3V2aaBiHl5xoCdvIQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!654933570200!e!!g!!amazon%20codewhisperer!19966639614!148446413896)
- It's not a race
- Some exercises can have multiple solutions/outcomes, they are meant to inspire

_Note on Copilot and AmazonCodeWhisperer: You can complete all the exercises without them by prompting in the web ui of the chat bots. Of course it's more fun working in your IDE of choice._

### The Google Meet:

Please join [this google meet](https://meet.google.com/oaa-baaj-wft) with your mic off. This will be our chat for sharing funny prompts or for questions later on.

Again, if there is something wrong with an exercise or you are stuck, or you have a question. I'll be happy to help you.

Have fun!

And

Happy prompting / coding!
