# Generative Ai Exercises

Hi there, thanks for cloning this repository. You are awesome!

As you can see the project exists out of separate folders all prefixed with a number.
So have a look at the exercises and complete/solve or play through them starting with the first one.

# Pairing is caring ü§ù

It can always be fun to work in "pairing" mode, as developers do it all the time.
This way we can get to know each other a little bit better and we can help each during the code session.

### Some Ground Rulesüëá:

- Do not spoil the exercises (ex: shouting out the answer to the group)
- If you are stuck, please ask for help.
- Go and use as many AI tools as you must. ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, etc.
- It's not a race
- Some exercises can have multiple solutions/outcomes, they are meant to inspire

### The Google Meet:

Please join this google meet with your mic off. [LINK TO GOOGLE MEET]
This will be our chat for sharing funny prompts or for questions later on.
