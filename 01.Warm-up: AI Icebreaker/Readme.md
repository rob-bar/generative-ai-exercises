# Warm-up: AI Icebreaker

Let's do the first exercise all together. No real dev knowledge involved here yet...ðŸ¥º

Come up with some funny or interesting responses. Be creative, sky is the limit.
Share your prompt or screenshot with the group via the chat.

Here ðŸ‘‰

### Some Tips:

- What about all those spell checks in Bard that are not really that accurate?
  Can you prompt it for a wrong answer?
- Maybe you want to test on some mathematical concepts, remember the failure where `1 + 1 = 2` isn't always 2 for chatGPT?
- Can you get one of the AI bots emotional? ðŸ˜­
- Maybe you can get it to say something inappropriate, religious or political?
- It's very good at making things up, maybe it is one prompt away from telling it's next "dad joke", and feel free to share it with the group if it's a good one.

We want to demonstrate the versatility of the models with this exercise.
